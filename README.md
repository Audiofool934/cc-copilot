**A copilot for AI coding agents.**

GitHub Copilot made codebases easier to read.\
CC-Copilot makes agent runtimes easier to follow.

Modern coding agents don't just autocomplete code anymore. They plan, edit,
test, fail, retry, and continue for hours across Claude Code, Codex, and
multi-session workflows. That creates a new developer problem: not just
understanding the codebase — understanding what your agents have been doing
over time.

CC-Copilot is a separate, **read-only** supervision layer for that work. Its
primary interface is the **cockpit**, a terminal-native TUI for live agent
supervision: shared context, grounded questions, risk signals, and next
decisions. Ask across one session, selected sessions, or an entire project —
without injecting supervision chatter into the main Claude Code or Codex
workflow.

The working agent stays focused. You stay aligned.

![CC-Copilot demo — re-entry recap, grounded chat, model picker](docs/demo.gif)

*Above: coming back to an agent session — the `/since` re-entry recap of what
happened while you were away, a streamed citation-pinned answer to "is it safe
to merge?", and the two-level model picker.*

## Quick Start

```bash
cc-copilot            # no arguments = open the cockpit
```

Or start your agent and the cockpit together, side by side (tmux):

```bash
cc-copilot launch                 # claude left (2/3), cockpit right (1/3)
cc-copilot launch codex           # any agent command works
cc-copilot launch -- claude --resume
```

`launch` splits the window (or creates a tmux session and attaches), starts the
agent, and the cockpit waits for that agent's session to appear and pins itself
to it. No tmux? It tells you and opens the cockpit alone.

The **first launch** greets you with a one-time welcome screen to pick the model
that powers recaps, chat, and `since` — **Claude** or **Codex** (uses the
agent's own login, no API key) or an **API provider** (OpenAI / DeepSeek /
OpenRouter, key captured inline). It only shows once; reopen it anytime with
`/init`, or run `cc-copilot init` in a plain terminal (handy over SSH). The
deterministic core (`brief` / `check` / `observe`) needs no model at all.

![CC-Copilot first-run welcome screen](docs/welcome.png)

Inside the cockpit:

```text
/sessions   choose one or more agent sessions (incl. your own live session)
/here       observe the session you're running inside of
/target     show the current cockpit target (id, evidence session, scope)
/status     fleet board — every session in this project, neediest first
/watch      follow the attached session's progress until `/watch stop`
/observe    attention queue and next human decision
/now        recommend the next step from the completed work (LLM; deterministic fallback)
/since      recap since you last looked (or 30m / 2h / 1d; --raw = cited delta)
/handoff    shareable Markdown handoff (brief + what changed)
/brief      deterministic recap with citations
/check      safety / off-track verdict
/diff       changes since last turn
/model      choose backend/model
/init       reopen the model picker (Claude / Codex / an API key)
/resume     browse & resume a cockpit session
```

## Install

One command, no clone — install it as an isolated tool:

```bash
uv tool install "cc-copilot[tui]"      # recommended (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
# or
pipx install "cc-copilot[tui]"
```

Then:

```bash
cc-copilot
```

Or run it without installing anything:

```bash
uvx --from "cc-copilot[tui]" cc-copilot cockpit
```

Requirements: Python 3.9+. The CLI core is **dependency-free**; the cockpit TUI
pulls in the optional `[tui]` extra (Textual) — drop it (`cc-copilot` instead of
`cc-copilot[tui]`) if you only want the command-line briefs.

<details>
<summary>plain <code>pip</code> / from source</summary>

```bash
pip install "cc-copilot[tui]"                         # from PyPI
# from a clone (development):
pip install -e ".[tui]"
```

On fresh Debian/Ubuntu servers `pipx`/venv may need:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv python3-pip pipx
```

## Why CC-Copilot

Past copilots reduced the cognitive burden of understanding code.

Agentic coding creates a new burden: understanding what agents are doing over
time. Long-running Claude Code, Codex, and multi-agent workflows produce
continuous context: plans, edits, tests, failures, retries, tool calls,
partial progress, and decisions. When those sessions run for hours or
overnight, you need a way to re-enter the work without reading the entire
transcript.

CC-Copilot is built for that supervision layer. It lets you inspect, ask,
compare, and realign — without interrupting the working agent or polluting
the agent's main conversation.

**Prior art.** CC-Copilot is influenced by Claude Code's `/btw` and the Codex
desktop app's Sidechat. Those tools point toward an important new pattern:
side-channel supervision for agentic coding. CC-Copilot extends that idea into
a broader runtime cockpit: cross-session context, project-level evidence,
resumable supervision sessions, and flexible model backends. The TUI takes
design cues from [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).

## What You Can Do

- **Re-enter after stepping away** —
  `/since` shows what changed while you were gone: commands run, failures,
  files touched, status transitions — every claim pinned to a transcript line
  you can check.

- **Ask without interrupting** —
  Supervision questions live in the cockpit, not in the agent's context. The
  agent's working conversation stays clean.

- **Follow multiple sessions** —
  Inspect one session, selected sessions, or project-level context — Claude
  Code and Codex side by side on one board.

- **Know when you're needed** —
  Stalls, fail-streaks, edit-thrash, and retry loops fold into a
  CLEAR / REVIEW / INTERVENE verdict, with desktop alerts for unattended runs.

- **Keep answers grounded** —
  The model only ever sees deterministic, line-cited evidence: transcript
  lines, tool results, git state, project facts. If it can't cite it, it
  doesn't claim it.

- **Use the model you want** —
  Your existing Claude or Codex login (no API key), or DeepSeek, OpenAI,
  OpenRouter, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Groq, Grok, Gemini, local Ollama — any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint or custom CLI backend.

## Usage

```bash
cc-copilot cockpit                 # open the TUI
cc-copilot sessions                # list project sessions
cc-copilot status                  # fleet board, neediest first
cc-copilot observe                 # attention queue + next human decision
cc-copilot now                     # grounded LLM recommendation of the next step
cc-copilot now --raw               # deterministic next-step, no model call
cc-copilot brief                   # deterministic recap with citations
cc-copilot check                   # safety / off-track verdict
cc-copilot since                   # grounded LLM recap since you last looked
cc-copilot since 30m               # …or within a time window (30m / 2h / 1d)
cc-copilot since --raw             # the deterministic cited delta, no model call
cc-copilot handoff --out h.md      # shareable Markdown handoff (brief + what changed)
cc-copilot watch --notify          # desktop alert when the agent needs you
cc-copilot goal --raw              # paste-ready agent /goal from current evidence
cc-copilot ask "what changed?"     # one-shot grounded Q&A
cc-copilot chat                    # plain terminal chat mode
cc-copilot resume                  # resumable Cockpit Sessions
```

Scope options:

```bash
cc-copilot cockpit                 # one agent session by default
cc-copilot cockpit --scope multi   # selected/all sessions in this project
cc-copilot cockpit --scope project # project-level evidence context

cc-copilot ask --scope multi --scope-sessions a1b2c3d4,b5c53c29 "compare these"
cc-copilot observe --scope project
```

Session discovery spans every coding agent with sessions on this machine:

```text
${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session>.jsonl   # Claude Code
${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl              # Codex
```

A project's sessions from both agents appear on one board, grouped by project
cwd and tagged with their agent. Restrict the set with `--agent claude`,
`--agent codex`, `$CC_COPILOT_AGENTS`, or `[agents] enabled` in the config.

By default, commands report on the most recent session other than the current
one, so running CC-Copilot from inside a live agent session watches the agent
you want to supervise. To watch your **own** current session instead, use
`--here` (e.g. `cc-copilot cockpit --here`) or `/here` inside the cockpit — it is
also always listed in `/sessions` as "your live session", even across projects.
See [docs/cross-model-adapters.md](docs/cross-model-adapters.md).

## Cockpit

The cockpit is the main product surface.

It gives you:

- Status header for project, evidence range, Cockpit Session, backend, and risk.
- Live activity strip from the observed session(s).
- Attention queue and next human decision via `/observe`.
- Paste-ready agent goals via `/goal`, generated from observed agent evidence
  plus read-only project context; cc-copilot shows the command, it does not
  inject it into the agent.
- Grounded chat over one session, selected sessions, or project evidence.
- Context HUD showing estimated input context, output estimate, and evidence
  split across raw transcript, project facts, chat, memory, and summary index.
- Attached-sessions HUD immediately above the composer, so you can see whether
  the next prompt is grounded in one session, selected sessions, or the project.
- `/watch` mode for long-running agent work: it follows transcript growth,
  summarizes meaningful progress in chat, and stays read-only.
- Background alerts when the agent stalls, errors, or goes off track.
- Checkbox session picker with `[ ]` / `[x]` multi-select.
- Resumable Cockpit Sessions via `/resume`.

Keyboard is primary; mouse works too. Click anywhere to return focus to the
composer. `Enter` sends, `Ctrl+J` inserts a newline, `/` opens command
suggestions, and `Ctrl+P` opens the command palette. `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` resize
the activity timeline (the chat fills the rest); the height is remembered across
launches.

The composer keeps prompt history: `↑` / `↓` browse prior prompts while the box
is focused. `Esc` clears a draft; double-`Esc` on an empty composer opens
rewind. With an empty composer, `←` / `→` jump between prior prompts in the chat.
The one-line sticky prompt at the top of the chat shows the current prompt's
first line and can be clicked to jump back to it.

## While You Were Away

The hardest part of supervising long-running agents is *re-entry*: you stepped
away, the agent kept working, and now you have to reconstruct what happened.

- **`since`** answers "what changed since I last looked" — by default a short
  **LLM recap narrated from** the deterministic, cited diff of new asks, agent
  messages, commands, failures, changed files, and any status/safety transition
  (the model sees only that cited delta and keeps its `[L…]` citations; `--raw`
  or no backend gives the deterministic delta itself). cc-copilot remembers where
  you last looked (a
  small marker under `$CC_COPILOT_STATE_DIR`, never under `~/.claude`/`~/.codex`);
  the cockpit stamps it when you leave and greets you with "⟳ N new since you last
  looked" when you return. Or scope by time: `since 30m`, `since 2h`.
- **`handoff`** turns the current state into a shareable Markdown document — the
  brief plus an optional "while you were away" section — to paste into a ticket
  or hand to a teammate. Every line keeps its `[L…]` citation.
- **`watch --notify`** pings you (desktop notification, terminal-bell fallback)
  only when a session *crosses into* needing you — a fresh intervene verdict, a
  slide into stalled, or a new failure — so you can step away without missing the
  moment it actually needs a human.

All three are LLM-free and work across Claude Code and Codex sessions.

## Evidence Context

v0.7 introduced the Evidence Context Engine.

For model-backed `ask`, `chat`, and cockpit answers, CC-Copilot now retrieves
primary evidence first:

- raw assistant messages
- raw human prompts
- tool calls and tool results
- cited line windows
- recent transcript tail
- selected multi-session records
- read-only project facts
- git/file evidence
- cockpit conversation memory

Summaries still exist, but they are navigation aids and UI surfaces, not the
only source of truth. See [docs/evidence-context-engine.md](docs/evidence-context-engine.md).

## Models

```bash
cc-copilot backends
cc-copilot cockpit --backend codex
cc-copilot cockpit --backend claude
cc-copilot ask "what matters next?" --backend openai --model gpt-5.5
```

Supported backend families:

| backend | authentication | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `codex` | your `codex login` | default; local agent CLI |
| `claude` | your Claude Code login | `claude -p`; no API key |
| `gemini` / `llm` | the CLI's own config | if installed on PATH |
| `deepseek` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | `deepseek-v4-flash` default (`-chat` is deprecated 2026-07-24) |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-5.4` default |
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | any OpenRouter model |
| `moonshot` | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | Kimi (`kimi-k2.6`) |
| `zai` | `ZAI_API_KEY` | GLM (`glm-5.1`) |
| `qwen` | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | Qwen via DashScope; mainland endpoint via `DASHSCOPE_API_BASE` |
| `groq` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | fast open-weights hosting |
| `xai` | `XAI_API_KEY` | Grok (`grok-4.3`) |
| `gemini-api` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google's OpenAI-compat endpoint (≠ the `gemini` CLI) |
| `ollama` | none | local server at `http://localhost:11434` |
| `custom` | `CC_COPILOT_API_BASE` or `CC_COPILOT_LLM_CMD` | proxy/API/CLI escape hatch |

Each API provider ships a small **curated model list** (see `cc-copilot backends
--models`): the `/model` picker offers them two-level — backend, then model —
and typed fast-paths work too: `/model deepseek-v4-pro` (model only),
`/model deepseek:deepseek-v4-pro` (both at once), or any free-form id.

Answers **stream** as the model produces them (claude: token deltas; the HTTP
backends: SSE; codex: whole message + exact usage), and when the backend
reports exact token usage it replaces the HUD's `~` estimate — including the
turn's real cost for claude. `CC_COPILOT_STREAM=0` opts out of streaming.

Set defaults once — the guided way (pick a model, capture an API key):

```bash
cc-copilot init           # interactive wizard (also runs on the first cockpit launch)
```

Or scaffold/inspect the file directly:

```bash
cc-copilot config --init  # write a commented starter ~/.cc-copilot.toml
cc-copilot config         # show the effective backend
```

Example `~/.cc-copilot.toml`:

```toml
backend = "codex"
# model = "..."

[history]
enabled = true
```

Precedence: explicit flags > environment variables > config file > built-in
default.

## Read-Only Contract

CC-Copilot is an observer.

It reads:

- agent transcripts
- session metadata
- read-only project facts
- git status
- cited file excerpts
- saved cockpit conversation state

It does not:

- mutate the observed agent session
- edit project files
- run tools on behalf of the observed agent
- write under `~/.claude`
- inject supervision chatter into Claude Code or Codex

Deterministic commands work without an LLM:

```bash
cc-copilot brief
cc-copilot observe
cc-copilot check
cc-copilot status
```

Interactive `/diff` is available inside the cockpit and `cc-copilot chat`.

LLM-backed answers receive bounded cited evidence context, not tool access or
ambient repo access. Secret-shaped content (API keys, tokens, private keys, auth
headers, secret-named `KEY=value` lines) is scrubbed from that context before it
reaches the model — the redaction applies only to the model-bound copy, so the
on-disk transcript, the `[L<n>]` citations, and what the cockpit shows you
locally are untouched. Agent narrator CLIs (Claude/Codex) are launched
read-only and **fail closed**: if the installed CLI can't be confined to
read-only, cc-copilot refuses to launch it rather than run it unguarded.

`/goal` follows the same read-only contract. It drafts a paste-ready agent
command from the selected evidence and project facts:

```text
/goal <verifiable outcome, checks, constraints, and blocked stop condition>
```

Use the generated command in Claude Code or Codex when you want the agent to
keep working toward a concrete finish line.

## Cockpit Sessions

A Cockpit Session is separate from an agent session.

It stores:

- your supervision Q&A
- backend/model selection
- project cwd
- selected evidence sessions
- durable compacted memory for older Q&A

Changing evidence with `/sessions` changes what the current cockpit reads; it
does not switch to another Cockpit Session.

Saved state lives under:

```text
${CC_COPILOT_STATE_DIR:-~/.local/state/cc-copilot}
```

Directories are `0700`, files are `0600`. Disable persistence with:

```bash
cc-copilot cockpit --no-persist
```

or:

```toml
[history]
enabled = false
```

## How It Works

```text
sources/        agent adapters: discover sessions + parse a transcript
  base.py         the AgentSource contract + registry/dispatch
  claude.py       Claude Code (~/.claude/projects/**)
  codex.py        Codex (~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl)
transcript.py   the normalized record model Claude Code parses into
state.py        fold records into deterministic session state
assess.py       classify stalls, failures, retry loops, and safety signals
brief.py        render deterministic cited recaps
since.py        "what changed since you last looked" (cited diff)
lastlook.py     remember where the human last looked (per session)
handoff.py      a shareable Markdown handoff artifact
notify.py       conservative away-alerts (desktop / terminal)
observe.py      rank attention and next human decision
scope.py        collect session, multi-session, and project evidence
context.py      retrieve raw evidence for model-backed answers
store.py        persist resumable Cockpit Sessions and compacted memory
backends.py     call Codex, Claude, OpenAI-compatible APIs, Ollama, etc.
tui.py          the cockpit (Textual TUI)
```

Agent specifics live entirely in `sources/`. Each adapter supplies just two
things — discovery and parse — and emits the same normalized records, so state,
assessment, briefing, context, and cockpit are agent-agnostic. One cockpit can
watch Claude Code and Codex sessions side by side, grouped by project. Adding
another agent (Gemini CLI, Aider, …) is a new `sources/` adapter, not a rewrite.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Audiofool934/cc-copilot.git
cd cc-copilot
pip install -e ".[tui]"          # editable install with the cockpit extra

python3 -m unittest discover     # stdlib-only test suite
cc-copilot cockpit
```

Core tests are stdlib-only. Textual is optional and lazy-imported by the cockpit.
Releases publish to PyPI automatically on a `v*` tag — see
[`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Roadmap

- Homebrew tap + a `curl | sh` one-line installer
- deeper project evidence retrieval and file ranking
- additional transcript parsers beyond Claude Code and Codex
- hook-driven push alerts for unattended runs

Rust migration is tracked separately in [docs/rust-migration.md](docs/rust-migration.md).

## Philosophy

The main agent conversation should stay focused on doing the work.

Supervision is a different job: inspect what happened, compare evidence, ask
what matters, preserve decisions, and decide whether to intervene. Mixing that
into the working agent thread creates noise and changes the very context you
are trying to observe.

CC-Copilot keeps supervision outside the main workflow. The cockpit is where
the human can regain situational awareness without contaminating the agent's
own conversation.

**Not a copilot for code. A copilot for the agent runtime.**
