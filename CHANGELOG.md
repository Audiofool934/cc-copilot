# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

**Persistent copilot history** — your Q&A with the copilot now survives.
- Each conversation is keyed to the observed Claude Code session and stored locally
  (append-only JSONL + a derived meta cache) under `$CC_COPILOT_STATE_DIR` >
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cc-copilot` > `~/.local/state/cc-copilot`. Never under `~/.claude`.
- Switching sessions in the cockpit (or `/use`, or relaunching) now **restores** that
  session's prior dialogue instead of wiping it — the reported data loss.
- `/history` (Ctrl+H) browses & restores past conversations; `/history this|all` in the
  REPL; standalone `cc-copilot history [--all]`. Works even if the transcript is gone
  (read-only history-only view).
- Concurrency-safe: a single `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` guards the whole append+meta write and
  the turn count is re-derived under the lock (two cockpits on one session can't corrupt or
  drift it). No silent unsafe fallback. All writes best-effort — a storage error never
  breaks an answer or the read-only contract. Dirs 0700 / files 0600.
- Opt out with `--no-persist`, `[history] enabled = false`, or `CC_COPILOT_HISTORY=0`.

**Cockpit input**
- Click anywhere in the cockpit to focus the composer (the timeline/chat panes no longer
  steal focus) — fixes IME / multilingual input having no target.
- Full multilingual (CJK / emoji / accented) input; **Shift+Enter / Ctrl+J** now actually
  insert a newline (previously advertised but inert).

**UTF-8 everywhere** — CLI-backend subprocess output is decoded as UTF-8 regardless of the
host locale (a `C`/`POSIX` locale no longer mangles a Chinese/emoji answer); non-ASCII tool
args render natively in briefs. Test suite passes under `LC_ALL=C`.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First public cut. A read-only "shadow-memory" sidecar for long-running coding
agents (Claude Code, Codex, …) — faithful, evidence-cited.

**Core (zero-dependency)**
- `brief` — deterministic, evidence-cited recap; every claim cites a transcript line.
- `check` — off-track / "is it safe to continue" judgment (fail-streaks, edit-thrash,
  retry-loops, stalls, failing tests), recency-weighted; scriptable exit codes.
- `status` / `fleet` — at-a-glance board of every session in a project, neediest first.
- `ask` / `chat` — grounded LLM Q&A over the cited state (never the raw transcript).
- `state --json`, `watch`, `sessions`.
- Faithful by construction: harness `isMeta`/`isCompactSummary`/`<synthetic>` noise
  filtered; failed edits excluded; cc-copilot's own narration sessions hidden.
- Adversarially audited (3 rounds, ~150 citations): 0 fabrications, 0 critical/major.
- 43 unit tests.

**Pluggable backends**
- codex (ChatGPT OAuth, default), claude, gemini, llm, and any OpenAI-compatible
  HTTP API (deepseek, openai, openrouter, ollama, …) — stdlib-only.
- `~/.cc-copilot.toml` for default backend/model/keys.

**Cockpit TUI** (optional `cc-copilot[tui]` extra; auto-bootstrapped on first run)
- Full-screen Textual cockpit: branded theme + verdict pill, split agent-timeline /
  chat panes, per-role gutters, multiline composer, command palette, collapsible
  output, modal session/model pickers, watcher toasts, Markdown answers — with
  `[L…]` citation fidelity preserved.
